## 📚 Course Topics
Throughout this lecture, students will learn:

1. **Python Basics**
	- Python syntax and fundamentals  
	- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)  
	- Functions and modular programming  
	- Basic data manipulation  

2. **Baseline Machine Learning**
	- Supervised vs unsupervised learning  
	- Basic ML workflow  
	- Train-test split & simple model evaluation  

3. **Regression**
	- Linear & multiple regression  
	- Coefficient interpretation  
	- Evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²)  

4. **Classification**
	- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN  
	- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
	- Confusion Matrix  

5. **Clustering**
	- K-Means Clustering  
	- Hierarchical Clustering  
	- Cluster evaluation with silhouette score

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository will be organized by modules. Each module will contain lecture materials, exercises, and assignments.  
Students are expected to push their solutions into the corresponding module folder.

```bash
├── 01-modul/
├── 02-modul/
├── 03-modul/
├── 04-modul/
├── 05-modul/
└── README.md
```
