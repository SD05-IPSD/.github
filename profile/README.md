# 🌐 Infrastructure & Platform for Data Science

Welcome to the official repository for the Infrastructure & Platform for Data Science course.  
This repository will serve as a central place where students learn, practice, and collaborate by contributing their work through GitHub.

---

## 📚 Course Topics
Throughout this lecture, students will learn:

1. **Python Basics**
	- Python syntax and fundamentals  
	- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)  
	- Functions and modular programming  
	- Basic data manipulation  

2. **Baseline Machine Learning**
	- Supervised vs unsupervised learning  
	- Basic ML workflow  
	- Train-test split & simple model evaluation  

3. **Regression**
	- Linear & multiple regression  
	- Coefficient interpretation  
	- Evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²)  

4. **Classification**
	- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN  
	- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
	- Confusion Matrix  

5. **Clustering**
	- K-Means Clustering  
	- Hierarchical Clustering  
	- Cluster evaluation with silhouette score

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository will be organized by modules. Each module will contain lecture materials, exercises, and assignments.  
Students are expected to add their solutions into the corresponding module folder via the GitHub web interface.

```bash
├── 01-modul/
├── 02-modul/
├── 03-modul/
├── 04-modul/
├── 05-modul/
└── README.md
```
